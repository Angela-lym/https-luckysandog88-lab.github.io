  <h1>Linguistics</h1> 

  <h2>Angela</h2>
      <p>
        I am Angela, a Year 4 undergraduate student at the City University of Hong Kong, majoring in Linguistics and Language Applications. Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I have cultivated a solid foundation in the core subfields of linguistics, while also developing particular academic interests in psycholinguistics as well as phonetics and phonology. These domains have become central to my intellectual development and have guided the trajectory of my research training.

    <div class="intro">
      <h2>Year 1</h2>
      <p>
        In my first year, I was introduced to the breadth of linguistics through fundamental courses in syntax, semantics, sociolinguistics, and general linguistics. 
        These modules established the theoretical grounding necessary to understand the structural, cognitive, and social dimensions of language. 
        This initial exposure also sparked my interest in the cognitive aspects of language, motivating me to explore psycholinguistics more deeply in subsequent years.
      </p>

      <h2>Year 2</h2>
      <p>
        In my second year, I engaged in more specialized courses, particularly in phonetics and phonology, where I acquired knowledge of articulatory and acoustic properties of speech, 
        phonological systems, and cross-linguistic sound patterns. I also gained practical skills in phonetic transcription and acoustic analysis using spectrographic tools. 
        At the same time, I pursued psycholinguistics, a field that fascinated me for its integration of cognitive science and linguistics. 
        Through this study, I developed a deeper understanding of language acquisition, processing, and comprehension, which reinforced my interest in the cognitive underpinnings of language use.
      </p>

      <h2>Year 3</h2>
      <p>
        My third year marked a turning point, as I began to apply theoretical knowledge to empirical inquiry. I participated in research-oriented coursework and small-scale projects 
        that required the collection, analysis, and interpretation of linguistic data. In phonetics and phonology, I examined vowel quality through acoustic measurements, 
        while in psycholinguistics, I reviewed experimental work on bilingual processing and second language acquisition. 
        These projects not only enhanced my analytical and methodological skills but also confirmed my aspiration to pursue research in the intersection of sound systems and language cognition.
      </p>

      <h2>Year 4</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, in my final year, I am undertaking my undergraduate thesis, which focuses on how Cantonese speakers acquire and produce English vowel contrasts. 
        This project integrates my dual interests in psycholinguistics and phonetics/phonology, employing both experimental methods and acoustic analysis. 
        The thesis allows me to investigate the interplay between speech perception and production in second language acquisition, and it has provided me with valuable experience 
        in designing research, collecting data, and analyzing linguistic patterns systematically. Reflecting on my four years of academic training, I recognize that my undergraduate journey 
        has equipped me with theoretical knowledge, empirical research skills, and a critical perspective necessary for advanced study.
